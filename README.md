Technique to resized a images.One of the metrics that we can use is the value of the derivative at each point. This is a
good indicator of the level of activity in that neighborhood. If there is some activity, then
the pixel values will change rapidly. Hence the value of the derivative at that point would
be high. On the other hand, if the region were plain and uninteresting, then the pixel
values wouldnâ€™t change as rapidly. So, the value of the derivative at that point in the
grayscale image would be low. This thing is called enegry matrix.
For each pixel location, we compute the energy by summing up the X and Y derivatives at
that point. We compute the derivatives by taking the difference between the current pixel
and its neighbors. There are various possible ways to achive this

    1. Develop a matrix that detect horizontal and vertical edges
    and combine together.

    2. Use Filter - Sobel that works on same principle.
